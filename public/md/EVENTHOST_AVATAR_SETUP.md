# EventHost Avatar Upload - Setup Complete âœ…

## What Was Added

Avatar upload functionality has been added to the EventHost profile management system.

---

## 1. Database Changes

### Add Avatar Column (if needed)

Run this SQL in Supabase if the `avatar` column doesn't exist:

```sql
-- Add avatar column to EventHosts table
ALTER TABLE "EventHosts" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar TEXT;

-- Verify column was added
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'EventHosts'
  AND column_name IN ('avatar', 'host_image')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

**Note:** The table now has both `avatar` (for profile picture) and `host_image` (for future use).
